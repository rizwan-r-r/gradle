Be sure to check out the [public roadmap](https://blog.gradle.org/roadmap-announcement) for insight into what's planned for future releases.

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

<a name="config-cache"></a>
### Configuration cache improvements

The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build time by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing it for subsequent builds.
This feature can significantly improve build performance.

#### More precise information about file changes that cause a configuration cache miss

Before this release, when a configuration cache entry could not be reused due to a change to some file, the console output would show this message:

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has changed**.

even if the file was not actually changed, but removed, or replaced with a directory.

Starting with this release, you get additional information detailing the kind of change. For example:

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has been removed**.

or

> Calculating task graph as configuration cache cannot be reused because file '.../some-file.txt' **has been replaced by a directory**.

### Error and warning reporting improvements

#### Better warning message for some common variant ambiguity issues

When Gradle attempts to resolve a dependency and finds multiple variants are available, all of which define attributes that would satisfy the resolution request, the resolution fails with a [variant ambiguity error](userguide/variant_model.html#sub:variant-ambiguity).

A common scenario is that the all these variants contain only a single, unrequested attribute with distinct values.
The addition of this attribute to the resolution request would resolve the ambiguity.
This is almost always the desired solution to this problem, but the previous generic error message did not provide any guidance in this regard.

The new message explicitly suggests adding this missing attribute, if such an attribute exists:

```
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':consumer'.
    > Could not resolve com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.4.0.
        Required by:
            project :
        > The consumer was configured to find attribute 'org.gradle.category' with value 'documentation'. There are several available matching variants of com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.4.0
          The only attribute distinguishing these variants is 'org.gradle.docstype'. Add this attribute to the consumer's configuration to resolve the ambiguity:
            - Value: 'javadoc' selects variant: 'javadocElements'
            - Value: 'sources' selects variant: 'sourcesElements'
            - Value: 'other' selects variant: 'additionalDocs'
```

This also adds a suggestion to run the [`dependencyInsight` task](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:listing_project_dependencies) to view the full list of variants and attributes, as these are now omitted to make the message more clear.

```
* Try:
Use the dependencyInsight report with the --all-variants option to view all variants of the ambiguous dependency.  This report is described at https://docs.gradle.org/<VERSION>/userguide/viewing_debugging_dependencies.html#sec:identifying_reason_dependency_selection.
```

#### Explain when resolution fails due to lacking any resolvable variants

If a dependency is requested that declares no variants, dependency resolution will necessarily fail.

Previously, the error message was misleading, as it mentioned that none of the variants have attributes:

```
> No matching variant of project :subproject1 was found. The consumer was configured to find attribute 'attrA' with value 'value1' but:
    - None of the variants have attributes.
```

While technically true, this failed to emphasize the more important fact that there were no available variants found at all.

The new message now makes this clear:

```
> No matching variant of project :producer was found. The consumer was configured to find attribute 'color' with value 'green' but:
    - No variants exist.
```

### Changes to init task behavior

The [`init` task](userguide/build_init_plugin.html) will now ask the user to confirm before proceeding if there are any files in the project directory, including Gradle `settings.gradle(.kts)` and `build.gradle(.kts)` files.

This change is intended to prevent accidental overwriting of existing files in the project directory.

A new `--overwrite` option has been added to the init task to allow users to bypass this confirmation message.
This can be used if initialization is cancelled or fails, and the user wants to re-run the init task without being prompted to confirm.

If the user declines to overwrite files that exist, or if the `--no-overwrite` option is provided, initialization will fail with the message:

```Aborting build initialization due to existing files in the project directory: <PATH>```

The exception to this behavior is when Gradle detects an existing Maven build via the presence of a `pom.xml` file - these builds will be converted to Gradle builds without prompting.

### New TestNg Options supported

The [TestNGOptions](javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/testng/TestNGOptions.html) class now supports configuring the following options:

`suiteThreadPoolSize`

More information about this option is available in the [TestNG documentation](https://testng.org/#_command_line_parameters).

### Isolated Projects usability improvements

The [Isolated Projects](userguide/isolated_projects.html) feature isolates the configuration models of projects from each other such that the build logic of one project cannot directly access the mutable state of another project.

#### String-notated task dependency is not a violation anymore

Depending on a task from another project in string-notated form is a common idiom:

```
foo.dependsOn(":a:bar")
```

Starting with this release, this is no longer considered a violation of Isolated Projects boundaries.

#### `gradle init` generates Isolated Projects compatible projects

The [Build Init Plugin](userguide/build_init_plugin.html) supports creating multi-module projects.

Starting with this release, `gradle init` generates projects compatible with Isolated Projects restrictions.
